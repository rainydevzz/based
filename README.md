**DISCLAIMER:** Some of these apps may violate the respective TOSs of the corporations they relate to, although I will mention apps that are not owned by a for-profit organization. I am not responsible for damages, bans, or other consequences from using these softwares.

This is a general collection of software I use to get around nasty corporations and their policies. It is a personal list but is open to suggestion and improvement. Enjoy!\
If it is worth noting, I am running all of the mobile apps on a Pixel 7 with GrapheneOS and the desktop apps on Arch and/or NixOS GNU/Linux.

### Media Service Alternatives

[Mobilism Spotify Mod](https://forum.mobilism.org/viewtopic.php?t=5135132) - ad-free Spotify mod for Android, available for multiple variants of the ARM architecture. I'm not sure if this one is FOSS, and the download links are pretty addy, but I haven't had any issues with it.

[BlockTheSpot/SpotX](https://github.com/SpotX-CLI/BlockTheSpot#fully-automated-installation-via-powershell) - An ad-blocking/anti-tracking script for Spotify's Windows client (it appears they have scripts for Linux as well but I've yet to test them)

[NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/) - Ad-free Youtube client for Android. FOSS and works great, good features and has options for background play which is super helpful.

[Invidious](https://invidious.io/) - A self-hosted FOSS Youtube frontend, removing ads/trackers and creating a minimalist experience. Public instances are available on their website.

[Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) - A self-hosted FOSS media hosting service. Host it on your own machine to host videos/movies/etc like your own personal Netflix.

[4get](https://4get.ca/about) - A self-hosted FOSS metasearch engine. What this means is that it proxies and scrapes from other search engines to improve privacy.

### Chat/Social Service Alternatives

[Aliucord](https://aliucord.com/) - FOSS Discord client mod for Android. Provides a robust collection of plugins and themes.

[Armcord](https://armcord.app/) - FOSS Discord client avaiable for several architectures, but is built for the desktop. Features anti-tracking and the option to install a mod like Vencord for additional plugins and themes.

[Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) - FOSS Discord client mod for desktop. Provides a robust collection of plugins and themes.

[Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/) - A collection of FOSS, decentralized social platforms that communicate with one another; behaves somehwat similarly to Twitter but there are still many differences.

[Matrix](https://matrix.org/) - An open decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, and FOSS protocol for communication. I use the [Element](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/element/) client personally but there are several available.


### Other

[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) - Possibly one of the most important entries on this list, F-Droid is a FOSS package manager for Android, from which you can install many of the apps listed.
